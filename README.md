# Super Style Sheets

A project of [The Great Code Club](http://www.greatcodeclub.com/).

SSS is a CSS pre-processor, transpiler or compiler. It extends CSS with a few nice features such as nested rules and variables.

## Syntax

Here's what it looks like.

    body#home {
      background-color: #fff;

      @pad: 10px;

      .nestedRule {
        padding: @pad;
      }
    }

## Installation

You need:

- A recent version of [node](http://nodejs.org/).
- Make. You should have it already.

    $ npm install
    $ make

## Usage

To compile an SSS file to CSS:

    $ bin/sss samples/simple.sss

To run the tests:

    $ make test

Or to run the tests on file change:

    $ make watch

## How to browse the code

Here are the files you should take a look at, in logical order:

1. `lib/tokens.jisonlex` defines the tokens produced by the lexer.
2. `lib/grammar.jison` is the grammar defining the syntax. It is compiled to `parser.js`.
3. `lib/nodes.js` contains the nodes created in the grammar.
4. `lib/context.js` represents the current context (scope) during compilation.
5. `lib/sss.js` is the public API, putting everything together.
6. `bin/sss` is the command line interface.

## Possible extensions

Here are a few ideas to extend this project:

- Add option to output compressed CSS.
- Implement full CSS selector support: `h1, h2`, `h1 + p`, `[attribute=...]`, etc.
- Make ';' optional.
- Add @import support. Loading .sss (.css) files from inside a .sss file.
- Add support for functions. Eg.: `background-color: saturate(#def, 20%)`.

Happy coding!
